# Library Management System API

This is a Flask API for managing a library’s books. It supports basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage the books in the library.

## API Methods

- **GET /books**: Retrieve a list of all books.
- **POST /books**: Add a new book to the library.
- **GET /books/<id>**: Retrieve a specific book by its ID.
- **PUT /books/<id>**: Update an existing book’s details.
- **DELETE /books/<id>**: Delete a book by its ID.

## Implementation

- The data is stored in-memory using a list of dictionaries.
- Basic error handling is implemented for missing parameters or invalid book IDs.

## How to Run

1. Install Flask using `pip install flask`.
2. Run the app with `python app.py`.
3. The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
